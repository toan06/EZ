## It's all about simple JavaScript, HTML5 , CSS, AJAX...
_at here all the code will be added to the *chrome URL*_ and runs on client's browser
### some notes:
* Most of the code will run on the user's browser
* No data will be stolen
* Most of the code is used by adding to the website to use
* And all run on _destop mode_ 
## Usage is also very simple
*_JavaScript ES6_*
* paste directly in the _URL_ or _Console_
