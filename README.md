## It's all about simple JavaScript, HTML5 , CSS, AJAX...
_at here all the code will be added to the *chrome URL*_ and runs on client's browser
### some notes:
* Most of the code will run on the user's browser
* No data will be stolen
* Most of the code is used by adding to the website to use
* And all run on _destop mode_ 
## Usage is also very simple
*_JavaScript ES6_*
* You need to go to the page where you want to run the code
* Go to the _URL_ bar delete the old URL and paste the code I put in the code description
* ex: URL is: ~https://google.com~ <= remove it and add 
>_JavaScript: alert("run!")_ 
__*I think only run on Chrome*__
* If you reload the page the code will be lost, or if you switch to another URL and then switch back the code will also be lost
## read
* Although the code is not complicated, I find it very interesting and the power of JavaScript in the browser is really strong.
* Since I'm just learning JavaScript, I wrote these for practice. So the code will be very newbie-like
* And partly because I write code on android, so this code is mostly used for android
